/**
    This is a script to explore a rock - scissors - paper card game, played by two humans and a
    robot, in which the robot can communicate with one of the humans through a discreet channel.
    Each round, a player can either select one of the other two players to play against. Rock beats
    scissors, scissors beats paper, and paper beats rock. Players (called users in the code) take
    turns, where in the first human player's rounds, the robot dicretely tells the human what card
    the robot has, and in the robot's rounds, the robot asks the human what card they have. This way,
    the odds are stacked against the second human, who can only guess (and thus has a 50% chance to
    win that round). Over many rounds, the first human player wins ~87%, the second human 0%, and the
    robot 4% of the time, with 7% chance of a tie happening.
